## Welcome to Chai

Chai is a Rails webapp for management of your team coffee order.

## Functional Requirmements

Currently useless, our MVP needs the following:

### User Stories


    In order to get a coffee
      As a consumer of coffee
      Given I have identified myself using my email address
      I want to order for the next available delivery
        Scenario: Submit a new choice of coffee
        Scenario: Submit a previous choice

    In order to know which drinks to buy
    As a coffee manager
      Given I have identified myself using my email address
      I want to view the coffee order
        Scenario: List all the coffees for a particular delivery

### Assumptions

 * Any user may be a coffee manager on any week
 * New staff can order without having to create a new account
